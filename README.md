## Known Problems

### iPhone/iPad permissions issues with microphone
You may experience permission problems on iOS devices. Make sure Siri is enabled. Using the built-in voice entry manually may enable the Mic.

### Android phones keep beeping constantly in continuous listening mode
This mode kicks in when you go silent for too long. This is considered a security "feature" by Google, that can't be disabled. You may consider turning off the mic when not conversing.
