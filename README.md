## Known Issues

### Natural voices on Edge
Edge may show a limited selection of languages/voices. Tap the "Read aloud this page" button in the address bar. You should see a larger selection under "Voice Options" while it is reading aloud. Now onwards you should see the same expanded list in 1parrot.com's language/voice selection.

Sadly, speech support seems to have been neutered on the mobile version. Please let us know if there is a workaround.

### iPhone/iPad permissions issues with microphone
You may experience permission problems on iOS devices. Make sure Siri is enabled. Using the built-in voice entry manually might enable the mic. Please let us know if you find a better workaround.

### Android phones keep beeping constantly in continuous listening mode
This mode kicks in when you go silent for too long. This is considered a security "feature" by Google, that can't be disabled. You may consider turning off the mic when not conversing.
