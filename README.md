## Known Problems

### iPhone/iPad permissions issues with microphone
You may experience permission problems on iOS devices. Make sure Siri is enabled. Using the built-in voice entry manually may enable the Mic.

### Android phones keep beeping constantly in continuous mode
This is a security "feature", that can't be switched off. Google probably frowns on you having a long conversation with an AI.
